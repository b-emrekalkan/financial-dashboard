# üí± FINANCIAL DASHBOARD WITH NEXT.JS üí∞

## üö© Creating the project

- To create a Next.js app, open your terminal,
- cd into the folder you‚Äôd like to keep your project,
- and run the following command:
- This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example"
cd nextjs-dashboard
```

- This command uses create-next-app, a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that sets up a Next.js application for you.
- In the command above, you‚Äôre also using the --example flag with the [starter example](https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example) for this course.

## üìÇ FOLDER STRUCTURE

- `/app:` Contains all the routes, components, and logic for your application, this is where you'll be mostly working from.
- `/app/lib:` Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions.
- `/app/ui:` Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these components for you.
- `/public:` Contains all the static assets for your application, such as images.
- `/scripts/:` Contains a file that you'll use to populate your database in a later chapter.
- `Config Files:` You'll also notice config files such as next.config.js at the root of your application. Most of these files are created and pre-configured when you start a new project using create-next-app. You will not need to modify them in this course.

## üìù PLACEHOLDER DATA:

When you're building user interfaces, it helps to have some placeholder data. If a database or API is not yet available, you can:

- Use placeholder data in JSON format or as JavaScript objects.
- Use a 3rd party service like [mockAPI](https://mockapi.io/).

For this project, we‚Äôve provided some placeholder data in `app/lib/placeholder-data.js.` Each JavaScript object in the file represents a table in your database. For example, for the `invoices table`:

```javascript
const invoices = [
  {
    customer_id: customers[0].id,
    amount: 15795,
    status: 'pending',
    date: '2022-12-06',
  },
  {
    customer_id: customers[1].id,
    amount: 20348,
    status: 'pending',
    date: '2022-11-14',
  },
  // ...
];
```

## üõ°Ô∏è TYPESCRIPT

- Take a look at the `/app/lib/definitions.ts` file. 
- Here, we manually define the types that will be returned from the database.
- For example, the invoices table has the following types:

```typescript
export type Invoice = {
  id: string;
  customer_id: string;
  amount: number;
  date: string;
  // In TypeScript, this is called a string union type.
  // It means that the "status" property can only be one of the two strings: 'pending' or 'paid'.
  status: 'pending' | 'paid';
};
```

### üõë By using TypeScript, you can ensure you don't accidentally pass the wrong data format to your components or database, like passing a string to amount instead of a number

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the development server

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

- `npm run dev` starts your Next.js development server on port 3000.
- Let‚Äôs check to see if it‚Äôs working. Open http://localhost:3000 on your browser.

# üö© CSS STYLING

## üõë Global Styles

- If you look inside the `/app/ui` folder, you'll see a file called `global.css.`
- You can use this file to add CSS rules to all the routes in your application - such as CSS reset rules, site-wide styles for HTML elements like links, and more.
- You can import `global.css` in any component in your application, but it's usually good practice to add it to your TOP-LEVEL component.
- In Next.js, this is the `ROOT LAYOUT` (more on this later).
- Add global styles to your application by navigating to `/app/layout.tsx` and importing the `global.css` file:

```typescript
import '@/app/ui/global.css';
 
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### ‚ÅâÔ∏è But wait a second, you didn't add any CSS rules, where did the styles come from?

- If you take a look inside `global.css`, you'll notice some `@tailwind` directives:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## üõë TAILWIND

- Tailwind is a CSS framework that speeds up the development process by allowing you to quickly write utility classes directly in your JSX markup.
- The CSS styles are shared globally, but each utility is singularly focused and applied to each individual element.
- This means you don't have to worry about style collisions, maintaining separate stylesheets, or your CSS bundle size growing as your application grows.
- In Tailwind, you add style elements by adding class names.
- For example, adding the class "text-blue-500" will turn the `<h1>` text blue:

```javascript
<h1 className="text-blue-500">I'm blue!</h1>
```

- When you use `create-next-app` to start a new project, Next.js will ask if you want to use Tailwind. If you select yes, it will automatically install the necessary packages and configure Tailwind in your application.

- If you look at `/app/page.tsx`, you'll see that we're using Tailwind classes in the example.

```typescript
import AcmeLogo from '@/app/ui/acme-logo';
import Link from 'next/link';
 
export default function Page() {
  return (
    // These are Tailwind classes:
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col p-6">
      <div className="flex h-20 shrink-0 items-end rounded-lg bg-blue-600 p-4 md:h-52">
    // ...
  )
}
```

### üîç Let's play with Tailwind! Copy the code below and paste it above the `<p>` element in `/app/page.tsx`

```typescript
<div className="h-0 w-0 border-b-[30px] border-l-[20px] border-r-[20px] border-b-black border-l-transparent border-r-transparent"/>
```
